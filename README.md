# Personal neovim config

- nothing of note so far
- licenced under GPL 3.0, same as the base Astronvim config

# TODO
- ~install nvim-surround~
- figure out how to show nvim-surround keymaps in which-key
- ~turn on (soft/hard ??) wrap by default~
- turn on bash formatting
- turn on visible white space somehow
